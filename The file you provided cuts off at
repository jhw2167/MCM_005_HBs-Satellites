Could you please provide the complete `SatelliteControllerBlockEntity.java` file so I can add the upgrades functionality and complete the implementation? I need to see the full file content to properly add:

1. The `Set<SatelliteItemUpgrade> upgrades` field
2. The `getUpgrades()` method
3. Proper NBT serialization/deserialization for the upgrades
4. Any other necessary methods

Once you provide the complete file, I'll return the full updated implementation using the proper file listing format.
