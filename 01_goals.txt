Requirements
---

1. Add some block entities
----
In the template that EmptyBlock was added (id: empty_block, name: Empty Block), please add a block "Holoblock Base" (id: holo_base_block) corresponding to the HoloBaseBlock.
Add the blockstate, item, and block jsonfiles as necessary. Also upate en_us to add the block name and description.
it should create a new HoloBaseBlockEntity when placed as block entities usually are. Add it to the ModBlocks where appropriate and ModItems.
This block should extend ChiselBlock and should have an assosiated HoloBaseBlockEntity but has no other special behavior, in the Block constructor, duplicate the properties of iron_block. I will add the appropriate texture with the PNG satellite_block.png.

In the template that EmptyBlock was added (id: empty_block, name: Empty Block), please add a block "Holoblock Base" (id: holo_base_block) corresponding to the HoloBaseBlock.
Add the blockstate, item, and block jsonfiles as necessary. Also upate en_us to add the block name and description. Use the png in art/holo_base_block.png for the texture
